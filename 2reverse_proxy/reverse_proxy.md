Great observation! Right now, you're seeing **only the backend response** (`Hello from Flask backend!`) because Nginx is reverse-proxying **all requests** (including `/`) to your backend app running on port 5000.

If you want a **frontend + backend separation**, like in real-world apps, you have **two choices**:

---

## üîß Option 1: Serve Static Frontend via Nginx and Proxy API to Backend

### üóÇ Folder Structure:

```
/var/www/myapp/html/index.html      ‚Üê frontend HTML (served by Nginx)
/api/*                              ‚Üê routed to backend app (e.g. Flask)
```

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step: Frontend + Backend with Reverse Proxy

### 1. Create a Frontend File

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/myapp/html
sudo nano /var/www/myapp/html/index.html
```

Paste:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>Frontend</title></head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello from Frontend</h1>
  <button onclick="fetch('/api/message').then(r => r.text()).then(alert)">Call Backend</button>
</body>
</html>
```

---

### 2. Update Flask Backend to Serve Only API

Update your `app.py`:

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/api/message')
def message():
    return 'Hello from Flask backend!'
```

Run it on port 5000 again:

```bash
python app.py
```

---

### 3. Update Nginx Config

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/myapp
```

Replace with:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name myapp.local;

    root /var/www/myapp/html;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

Then:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

---

### 4. Visit in Browser

Go to:
‚û°Ô∏è `http://myapp.local`

Click the button ‚Äî it will call `/api/message`, which Nginx proxies to Flask backend. You'll see an alert:

```
Hello from Flask backend!
```

‚úÖ Now your frontend is handled by Nginx and backend APIs are reverse proxied.

---

## üèÅ Result

* `/` ‚Üí served as static frontend (HTML/JS/CSS)
* `/api/*` ‚Üí reverse proxied to backend server (Flask in this case)

* Deploy with Docker?
* Separate frontend/backend into subdomains like `api.myapp.local` and `www.myapp.local`?
